# HPC_Spring_2023

This is a public repository that contains homework materials from the HPC Class at RIT taught by Yosef Zlochower.
Feel free to use it for your reference, I will try to comment the code as explicitly as possible. 
**Use for your reference but not as a cheat sheet!**

WARNING. If you are pulling the code for the homework submission, I strongly advise to use it just for understanding the problem and writing your own code. 
At least, change the variables and code structure, while it still works well. Sometimes, that would be the case, when the changes for the code are minor or pretty straightforward.
Please, use this repository as a learning tool, but not just copy the code for the homeworks. 
I can't track how you use it, so I hope for your own responsibility. 
If copying the code will be the case here, I will have to close the repository to avoid that. 

Please, comment and collaborate in the project, if you have your suggestions or have found the way to optimize the problem, or have found a bug in my code. 

Good luck all!
